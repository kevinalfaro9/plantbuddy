# Plantbuddy
Javascript based app that uses Firebase as backend. This project was for my capstone class at the University of Washington. 
There is a hardware component that has a moisture sensor where your plant can be set and that moisture sensor data gets fed to our Firebase backend. 
If the moisture level is low ever, we can activate the pump from the front end to pump water into our plant until the moisture level is back to baseline.
